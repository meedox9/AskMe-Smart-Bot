# Discord SmartBot

This is a discord bot that prints out information about something or someone when asked to. It operates on web scraping the wikipedia page of the target for the first two sentences of the first paragraph. This is possible by using the [wikipedia.py](https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia) library created by Jonathan Goldsmith that works as a wrapperfor the wikipedia API.
